##############################

Once you have Anaconda Python installed on your computer, you will need to create an environment for PsychoPy.

Open a command prompt (Windows) or a terminal (Mac/Linux) and enter the following:

conda create -n psychopy --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/CogSci psychopy pyglet wxpython pygame python=2.7

which means:

    conda create: use (Ana)conda to create a Python environment
    -n psychopy: named "psychopy"
    --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/CogSci: in addition to the normal package sources, look in the "CogSci" channel for the packages I need
    psychopy pyglet wxpython pygame: install these packages and any other packages that they depend on
    python=2.7: use Python 2.7 in this environment

Starting PsychoPy

To start the PsychoPy builder, enter the following in your terminal/command prompt:
Mac/Linux

source activate psychopy
conda activate psychopy
~/.conda/envs/psychopy-instructions/lib/python2.7/site-packages/psychopy/app/psychopyApp.py -b

Then, when you are done, enter:

source deactivate
